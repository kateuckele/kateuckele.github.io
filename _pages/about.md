Hi, I'm Kate. I'm a genomic data scientist, evolutionary biologist, and border collie mom. I earned my Bachelor's in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Michigan and later completed my PhD in the same field at the University of Nevada, Reno.

What started as an internship at an evolutionary genetics lab in Panama City quickly blossomed into a career fueled by a desire to understand how evolution shapes the natural world. That formative experience inspired me to pursue a PhD in evolutionary biology, where I discovered a genuine passion for computing, data analysis, and bioinformatics. Over the past three years as a postdoctoral researcher, I've been using genomic datasets to reconstruct evolutionary histories and uncover the genetic basis of complex traits. This work has led to several peer-reviewed publications with many cherished collaborators. 

Outside of work, I love trail running with my border collie, Luke. I organize the Missoula Data Meetup, where local scientists, analysts, and developers come together to share ideas and spark new collaborations. I am a big fan of professional basketball, especially the Detroit Pistons, and in my quieter moments, I enjoy sewing and reading.
