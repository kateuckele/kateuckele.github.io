Hybridization—the exchange of genetic material between species—is a widespread and fascinating phenomenon in natural plant populations. Hybrid zones, where distinct species meet and interbreed, serve as natural laboratories that allow us to explore the relationship between genetic variation and observable traits. In the eastern Sierras along the border of California and Nevada, three juniper species converge and hybridize, providing a unique window into the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological interactions that shape the outcomes of hybridization.

I processed and analyzed ddRADseq data from 25 populations across the hybrid zone, and used various population genetic analyses to elucidate population genetic structure and hybrid ancestry proportions. This approach revealed that the hybrids carry genetic ancestry from all three pure juniper species, with most individuals representing either first-generation (F1) hybrids or backcrosses, and very few advanced generation hybrids (beyond the F1 generation). Integrating the genetic data with a detailed analysis of leaf chemical profiles, I discovered that hybrids not only exhibit a broader range of chemical diversity but also exhibit novel phytochemical variation compared to pure species, suggesting important ecological ramifications on the landscape.
